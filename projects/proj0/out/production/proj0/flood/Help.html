<h1> Flood Puzzle </h1>

<p> The goal of this puzzle is make all the cells have the same color.
The cell in the upper-left corner and all cells that are
reachable by a series of horizontal and vertical steps that touch only cells of
the same color is called the <i>active region</i>.  Clicking on a cell of any
color differing from that of the active region changes all cells in the active  
region to that new color.  
</p>

<p> Each puzzle has a limit on the number of cells that may be selected.  The
puzzle must be completed within this number of moves. </p>
