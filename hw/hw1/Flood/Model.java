/** A simplified version of the Model class from the Flood project.
 *  Represents the state of a flood puzzle. The cells have 0-based column and row numbers,
 *  and each contains a non-negative number indicating a color. This simplified
 *  version contains only basic functionality such as constructing a Model instance from
 *  a 2D array, and getting information such as the color at a particular cell
 *  or the move limit for the Flood puzzle.
 *
 *  Again, this is a much simplified version, intended to familiarize students
 *  with the strucutre of the Model class in the Flood project.
